1.what is git stash & git rebase 
Purpose: Temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed, allowing you to switch branches without losing your work.
How it works: When you run git stash, Git takes your modified tracked files and saves them to a stash, reverting your working directory to the last commit. 
You can later apply these changes back with git stash apply or git stash pop, which also removes the stash after applying.
Use case: Useful when you need to quickly switch branches to work on something else and want to save your current work in progress without committing it.

2.what is git rebase
Rebasing creates a linear project history, which can make it easier to understand the progression of changes. 
This is in contrast to merging, which can create a more complex history with multiple branches.

3.what is cherry pick 
It is used to select and apply specific committs from one branch to another branch.
